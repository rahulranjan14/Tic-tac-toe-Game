# Tic-tac-toe-Game

We all have played the tic-tac-toe game in our childhood. I tried to created this game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
It's currently a Player vs Player game, i will try to add player vs computer mode in the future.

# How to play

As it is a Player vs player game, so two players should be there. (X) will be the player 1 and (O) will be the player 2.
All the codes are written in a single HTML document, so only a browser is required to run this file. Download this document and open
it with any browser. Once the game is over, refresh the page to play again.
